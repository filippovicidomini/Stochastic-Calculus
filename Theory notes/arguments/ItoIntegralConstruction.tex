\argomento{Construction of the Itô Integral}

\textbf{Goal.}  
Define the stochastic integral
\[
\int_0^t H_s \, dB_s
\]
for a process \( (H_s) \) adapted to the natural filtration \( (\mathcal{F}_s) \) generated by a standard Brownian motion \( (B_s) \), and satisfying suitable integrability conditions. This integral plays a fundamental role in stochastic calculus and in solving stochastic differential equations (SDEs).

\textbf{Step 1: Itô Integral for Simple (Elementary) Processes}  

A \textit{simple process} is a left-continuous, adapted process that is piecewise constant:
\[
H_s = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} H_i \, \mathbf{1}_{(t_i, t_{i+1}]}(s),
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( 0 = t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_n = t \) is a finite partition of \([0, t]\);
  \item Each \( H_i \) is \( \mathcal{F}_{t_i} \)-measurable and square-integrable.
\end{itemize}

The Itô integral of such a process is defined as:
\[
\int_0^t H_s \, dB_s := \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} H_i \left( B_{t_{i+1}} - B_{t_i} \right).
\]

\textit{Example.}  
Let \( B_t \) be Brownian motion and define
\[
H_s = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } s \in (0,1], \\
2 & \text{if } s \in (1,2].
\end{cases}
\]
Then,
\[
\int_0^2 H_s \, dB_s = (B_1 - B_0) + 2(B_2 - B_1).
\]
This is a linear combination of independent normal variables with mean zero.

\textbf{Step 2: Extension to General Square-Integrable Processes}  

Let \( H \) be an \( \mathcal{F}_t \)-adapted process such that:
\[
\mathbb{E} \left[ \int_0^t H_s^2 \, ds \right] < \infty.
\]
Then, there exists a sequence of simple processes \( (H^n_s) \) such that:
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{E} \left[ \int_0^t |H^n_s - H_s|^2 \, ds \right] = 0.
\]

We define the Itô integral of \( H \) as the limit (in \( L^2 \)):
\[
\int_0^t H_s \, dB_s := \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_0^t H^n_s \, dB_s.
\]

\textbf{Key Properties of the Itô Integral}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Linearity:} 
  \[
  \int_0^t (a H_s + b G_s) \, dB_s = a \int_0^t H_s \, dB_s + b \int_0^t G_s \, dB_s.
  \]
  \item \textbf{Itô Isometry:}
  \[
  \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( \int_0^t H_s \, dB_s \right)^2 \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ \int_0^t H_s^2 \, ds \right].
  \]
  \item \textbf{Martingale Property:}  
  If \( H \) is adapted and square-integrable, then the process
  \[
  M_t = \int_0^t H_s \, dB_s
  \]
  is a martingale with respect to \( (\mathcal{F}_t) \).
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Conceptual Insight}  
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Itô integral captures how \( H_s \) interacts with the random fluctuations of Brownian motion.
  \item Classical Riemann–Stieltjes integration fails for Brownian motion because of its infinite variation.
  \item Unlike the Stratonovich integral, the Itô integral evaluates the integrand at the \textit{left endpoint} of each interval in the partition. This asymmetry leads to Itô’s lemma including a correction term.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Example: Itô Integral of a Deterministic Function}  

Let \( H_s = s \), a deterministic and continuous function. Then:
\[
\int_0^t s \, dB_s
\]
is a Gaussian random variable with mean zero and variance:
\[
\mathbb{E}\left[\left( \int_0^t s \, dB_s \right)^2\right] = \int_0^t s^2 \, ds = \frac{t^3}{3}.
\]
Hence:
\[
\int_0^t s \, dB_s \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{t^3}{3}\right).
\]

\textbf{Conclusion}  

The Itô integral extends classical integration into the stochastic realm. It is first defined for simple adapted processes and then extended by density in \( L^2 \). Its key properties—linearity, isometry, and martingale behavior—make it an indispensable tool in the theory and application of stochastic differential equations.
